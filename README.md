# D20 modern equipment randomizer

Java applet that randomly generates equipment for use in a modified version of the D20 modern table-top role playing game.

I made this way back in high school in 2010 for use with an additional ruleset that my friends and I developed at the time. The ruleset has been subsequently lost.

The jar file should be executable on most systems, but I haven't really tested it lately.
